//JavaScript Fundamentals - Part 1

/*
LECTURE: Values and Variables
1. Declare variables called 'country', 'continent' and 'population' and
assign their values according to your own country (population in millions)
2. Log their values to the console
*/

/*
const country = "Czech republic";
const continent = "Europe";
let population = 10;

console.log("I live in the " + country + " in the " + continent + "." + " Our country has " + population + " millions inhabitants.");

/* 
LECTURE: Data Types 
1. Declare a variable called 'isIsland' and set its value according to your
country. The variable should hold a Boolean value. Also declare a variable
'language', but don't assign it any value yet
2. Log the types of 'isIsland', 'population', 'country' and 'language'
to the console
*/
/*
const isIsland = false;
//const language; it cannot be empty, if it is const
const language = "Czech";

console.log(typeof isIsland);
console.log(typeof population);
console.log(typeof country);
console.log(typeof language);

/*
LECTURE: let, const and var
1. Set the value of 'language' to the language spoken where you live (some
countries have multiple languages, but just choose one)
2. Think about which variables should be const variables (which values will never
change, and which might change?). Then, change these variables to const.
3. Try to change one of the changed variables now, and observe what happens
*/

// const language = "Czech"; already declared

/*
LECTURE: Basic Operators
1. If your country split in half, and each half would contain half the population,
then how many people would live in each half?
2. Increase the population of your country by 1 and log the result to the console
3. Finland has a population of 6 million. Does your country have more people than
Finland?
4. The average population of a country is 33 million people. Does your country
have less people than the average country?
5. Based on the variables you created, create a new variable 'description'
which contains a string with this format: 'Portugal is in Europe, and its 11 million
people speak portuguese'
*/

/*
let halfCountryPopulation = population / 2;
console.log("Half population of Czech republic is", halfCountryPopulation, "millions.")

console.log(population += 1);

const hasMorePopulation = population > 6;
console.log("It is", hasMorePopulation, "that Finland has bigger population than Czech republic.")

const moreThanAveragePopulation = population < 33;
console.log("It is", moreThanAveragePopulation, "that Czech republic has less people than average country.")

const description = `${country} is in ${continent}, and its ${population} million people speak ${language}.`
console.log(description);

/* LECTURE: Taking Decisions: if / else Statements
1. If your country's population is greater that 33 million, log a string like this to the
console: 'Portugal's population is above average'. Otherwise, log a string like
'Portugal's population is 22 million below average' (the 22 is the average of 33
minus the country's population)
2. After checking the result, change the population temporarily to 13 and then to
130. See the different results, and set the population back to original
*/

/*
if (population > 33) {
    console.log("Czech's population is above average");
    } else {
        console.log(`Czech's population is ${33 - population} millions below average.`)
    }
*/

/*
LECTURE: Type Conversion and Coercion
1. Predict the result of these 5 operations without executing them:
// 2. Execute the operations to check if you were right */

/*
'9' - '5'; // 4 (number)
'19' - '13' + '17'; // "617" (string)
'19' - '13' + 17; // 23 (number)
'123' < 57; // false
5 + 6 + '4' + 9 - 4 - 2; // 1143 (number)




/*
LECTURE: Equality Operators: == vs. ===
1. Declare a variable 'numNeighbours' based on a prompt input like this:
prompt('How many neighbour countries does your country
have?');
2. If there is only 1 neighbour, log to the console 'Only 1 border!' (use loose equality
== for now)
3. Use an else-if block to log 'More than 1 border' in case 'numNeighbours'
is greater than 1
4. Use an else block to log 'No borders' (this block will be executed when
'numNeighbours' is 0 or any other value)
5. Test the code with different values of 'numNeighbours', including 1 and 0.
6. Change == to ===, and test the code again, with the same values of
'numNeighbours'. Notice what happens when there is exactly 1 border! Why
is this happening?
7. Finally, convert 'numNeighbours' to a number, and watch what happens now
when you input 1
8. Reflect on why we should use the === operator and type conversion in this
situation
*/

/*
const numNeighbours = Number(prompt("How many neighbour countries does your country have?"));

if (numNeighbours === 1) { // if it is loose equality, it is ok, because input from prompt is string, but if we use strict equality, it is automatically "No borders"
    console.log("Only 1 border.")
} else if (numNeighbours > 1) {
    console.log("More than 1 border.")
} else {
    console.log("No borders.")
} */

/*
LECTURE: Logical Operators
1. Comment out the previous code so the prompt doesn't get in the way
2. Let's say Sarah is looking for a new country to live in. She wants to live in a
country that speaks english, has less than 50 million people and is not an
island.
3. Write an if statement to help Sarah figure out if your country is right for her.
You will need to write a condition that accounts for all of Sarah's criteria. Take
your time with this, and check part of the solution if necessary.
4. If yours is the right country, log a string like this: 'You should live in Portugal :)'. If
not, log 'Portugal does not meet your criteria :('
5. Probably your country does not meet all the criteria. So go back and temporarily
change some variables in order to make the condition true (unless you live in
Canada :D)
*/

/*
if (language === "English" && population < 50 && !isIsland) {
    console.log(`You should live in ${country}.`)
} else {
    console.log(`${country} does not meet your criteria.`)
}*/


/*
LECTURE: The switch Statement
1. Use a switch statement to log the following string for the given 'language':
chinese or mandarin: 'MOST number of native speakers!'
spanish: '2nd place in number of native speakers'
english: '3rd place'
hindi: 'Number 4'
arabic: '5th most spoken language'
for all other simply log 'Great language too :D'
*/

/*
switch(language) {
    case "chinese":
    case "mandarin":
        console.log("MOST number of native speakers");

        console.log("5th most spoken language");
        break;
    default:
        console.log("Great language too :D");
}*/

/*
LECTURE: The Conditional (Ternary) Operator
1. If your country's population is greater than 33 million, use the ternary operator
to log a string like this to the console: 'Portugal's population is above average'.
Otherwise, simply log 'Portugal's population is below average'. Notice how only
one word changes between these two sentences!
2. After checking the result, change the population temporarily to 13 and then to
130. See the different results, and set the population back to original
*/

/*
population > 33 ? console.log("Czech's population is above average.") : console.log("Czech's population is below average.")
console.log(`${country}'s population is ${population > 33 ? "above" : "below"} average.`)

/*Coding Challenge #1
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
and height in meter).
Your tasks:
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
Test data:
ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
m tall.
ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
m tall.

Coding Challenge #2
Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and
improve it.
Your tasks:
1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message
is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's
BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"

Coding Challenge #3
There are two gymnastics teams, Dolphins and Koalas. They compete against each
other 3 times. The winner with the highest average score wins a trophy!
Your tasks:
1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below
2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition,
and print it to the console. Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for that
as well (draw means they have the same average score)
3. Bonus 1: Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. With this rule, a
team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and the same time a
score of at least 100 points. Hint: Use a logical operator to test for minimum
score, as well as multiple else-if blocks ๐
4. Bonus 2: Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens when
both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or equal 100
points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy
Test data:
ยง Data 1: Dolphins score 96, 108 and 89. Koalas score 88, 91 and 110
ยง Data Bonus 1: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 123

Coding Challenge #4
Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a
restaurant. In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and
300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.
Your tasks:
1. Calculate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called 'tip' for
this. It's not allowed to use an if/else statement ๐ (If it's easier for you, you can
start with an if/else statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary
operator!)
2. Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value
(bill + tip). Example: โThe bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value
316.25โ
Test data:
